                <h2>About Our Company</h2>
                  <p>Hello<br></p>
                     <p>I, Jasmine Figueroa, am the CEO and founder of <em>Walk By Faith Customs</em>.<br>
                         I want to personally thank you for trusting me with your custom needs.</p>
                            My business, <em>Walk By Faith Customs</em> was encouraged by my husband, 
                            but was driven by my daughter, Faith. 
                            She inspired the name <em>Walk By Faith Customs</em>. 
                            I personalize every item with each individual customer in mind.
                        Every item is handcrafted & made with love.</p>
